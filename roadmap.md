Roadmap for the LibreZimbra project:

1. finish up build infrastructure
2. add some more documentation (eg. how to clone and build)
3. repair Zimbra build system
    * fix generating apt repo and local apt server
    * add a dozen of yet missing support packages (eg. perl modules), yet unclear where these are actually coming from
4. create CI with automatic deployment of test clusters
5. start repairing the 15 years old bugs
6. concepts for NE feature replacement (eg. zmmboxmove)
