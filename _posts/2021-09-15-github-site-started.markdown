Even yet in its infancy, the project is moving forward step by step.


Github org and page is now up and running, basic devel and build infrastructure
seems now working (somehow ;-)). Now getting to a stage when we can start
repairing the Zimbra build system and then take care of several of the now
15 years ignored bugs.


Feel free to leave some feedback (eg. tickets) or join the Telegram group.
