LibreZimbra release names


Zimbra has/had the tradition of naming major releases by old hardrock/metal bands,
whose first letter fits the major release number - last one is ''Judas Priest''.


Since LibreZimbra is a fork and cares very much for freedom, this tradition has
to undergo a few changes:

- names have to be different than from Synacor's choices
- instead of old bands with strong tendencies of their members moving six feet under,
  now picking younger (and perhaps not yet so famous) artits
- the picked artits shall be well known member in the peace and freedom movement


Since ''K'' is the next letter in line, the choice is [''Kilez More''](https://kilezmore.com) (austrian truth rapper),
minor releases will by named by his songs, beginning with ''Alchemist''.


For 10.x major release -- Roman number X -- the current candidate is Xavier Naidoo.
But it's still quite some time until we reach that point.
